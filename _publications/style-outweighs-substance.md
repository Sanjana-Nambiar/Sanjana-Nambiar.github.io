This paper examines whether preferences indicated by LLM judges correspond to tangible improvements in alignment metrics. It introduces SOS-Bench (Substance Outweighs Style Benchmark), the largest standardized LLM meta-benchmark to date, revealing that LLM-judge preferences often prioritize style over factual accuracy and safety. The study emphasizes the critical role of supervised fine-tuning in post-training for enhancing alignment, highlighting the importance of data scaling and prompt diversity.
