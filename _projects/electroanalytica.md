### ElectroAnalytica

**Description**: ElectroAnalytica is a Scala-based big data analytics project that leverages Apache Spark to analyze extensive datasets on electricity pricing, consumption, and electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The project aims to uncover insights and trends within these domains, providing valuable information for decision-making in energy management and policy formulation.

- **Language/Frameworks:** Scala, Apache Spark, Spark SQL, MLLIB
- **Features:**
  - **Electricity Pricing Analytics:** In-depth analysis of electricity rates, including data preparation, exploration, yearly and regional analysis, statistical evaluation of different rate types, and growth rate calculations.
  - **Merged Data Analysis:** Examination of combined datasets focusing on demand, pricing, and EV adoption, identifying top regions with the highest average demand and pricing, and performing aggregate analyses over time.
  - **EV Adoption Analysis:** Investigation of factors influencing EV adoption, particularly the impact of odometer readings on purchase decisions, with statistical computations such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
  - **Electricity Consumption Analytics:** Analysis of consumption patterns, including data aggregation by region and time, and assessment of growth rates in electricity demand and net generation.

#### Additional Information:
Developed to provide a comprehensive toolkit for researchers and analysts exploring dynamic relationships in the energy landscape, ElectroAnalytica utilizes big data techniques to offer actionable insights.
