### Gimmi – Community Rental Platform

**Description**: Gimmi is a startup lab concept focused on building a **community-driven rental marketplace** for everyday household items. Instead of purchasing new products or letting items sit unused, community members can easily **borrow, lend, or rent** items like tools, appliances, or furniture from each other.  

The idea promotes **sustainable consumption**, reduces waste, and fosters stronger local connections by making resource-sharing effortless and trustworthy.

- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Peer-to-Peer Rentals:** A platform where individuals can list items they’re willing to rent out and discover items available nearby.  
  - **Trust & Transparency:** Ratings, reviews, and verification features to ensure reliable exchanges.  
  - **Cost Efficiency:** Helping users save money by renting instead of buying items they rarely use.  
  - **Community Engagement:** Encouraging collaboration, reducing overconsumption, and building local trust networks.  

- **Tools & Methods:** Canva (pitch deck design), startup ideation frameworks, market research, business model development.  

#### Additional Information:
Gimmi was developed as part of a **startup lab pitch exercise**, combining business modeling with UX storytelling. The concept showcases how **sharing economy principles** can be applied at the neighborhood level to reduce environmental impact while offering financial and social benefits.
