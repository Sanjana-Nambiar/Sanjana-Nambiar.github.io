### ControlNet Analysis

**Description**: This project investigates the accuracy of image generation using ControlNet, a model designed to incorporate conditional inputs into text-to-image diffusion processes. The analysis emphasizes the Canny edge detection model within ControlNet, applying it to a dataset of horse images to assess performance.

- **Language/Frameworks:** Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Features:**
  - Implementation of ControlNet with Canny edge detection.
  - Conversion of datasets into Canny edge images for analysis.
  - Evaluation of image generation fidelity using ControlNet.
  - Detailed reporting on the model's performance metrics.

#### Additional Information:
Developed as part of a research initiative to enhance understanding of conditional diffusion models in image generation.
