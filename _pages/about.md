I’m **Sanjana Nambiar**, a Computer Science graduate from NYU Abu Dhabi with minors in Applied Mathematics and Engineering. My interests lie in **AI/ML security**, **privacy in AI systems**, **AI alignment**, and **optimization** techniques for building robust and ethical models. I’m also passionate about **product development** and **AI workflow optimization**, with hands‑on experience bridging research and real‑world impact.

In June 2025, I presented my bachelor thesis at the Security in Machine Learning and its Applications (SiMLA 2025), co‑located with ACNS 2025 in Munich. You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YXF5duFIcuPsV7E2arLNwX-EGhgvRXhgTqOktDS_XZE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [paper](https://sanjana-nambiar.github.io/files/SiMLA-2-main.pdf) *(to appear in Springer LNCS post‑proceedings).*

<h2>NEWS</h2>

<b>Glowcare: Multispectral AI Skin Diagnostics Platform (ASIIG Brief, 2026)</b><br>
Glowcare is an emerging AI-driven skin diagnostics platform combining multispectral facial imaging (RGB, UV, depth) with machine learning–based interpretation. A speculative research brief by the Adaptive Systems & Information Integrity Group (ASIIG) reports reduced inference variance (18–23%) and internal agreement rates of 82–91%, reflecting broader shifts toward perceptual, interpretable AI systems. <a href="/news7.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>Packet Interruption Freezing (PIF): Behavioral Latency in Networked Systems</b><br>
Packet Interruption Freezing (PIF) describes a newly identified behavioral latency state in network-dependent systems, where responsiveness fails to recover after packet-level interruptions. A January 2026 ASIIG research note frames PIF as a limitation of traditional reliability metrics, emphasizing the need for interruption-aware system design. <a href="/news8.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>Cognitive Drift Index (CDI): Measuring Attention Degradation in AI-Mediated Workflows</b><br>
The Cognitive Drift Index (CDI) is a proposed metric quantifying gradual attention misalignment in AI-assisted work. Across controlled studies (142 participants), CDI increased by 17–24% over prolonged AI interaction despite stable productivity, raising questions around agency and long-term cognitive effects. <a href="/news9.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>Geneva Carbon Exchange Accord (GCEA): Unified Global Carbon Market Announced</b><br>
The Geneva Carbon Exchange Accord (GCEA) establishes a unified global carbon trading framework across 68 nations, introducing standardized pricing, satellite-based emissions verification, and blockchain-backed trading infrastructure. Early modeling suggests potential global emissions reductions of 6–8% within five years, contingent on effective oversight and equitable access. <a href="/news10.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>VAX-Nova: Universal Vaccine Delivery Platform Announced by WHIC</b><br>
VAX-Nova is a universal vaccine delivery platform developed by the World Health Innovation Consortium (WHIC), designed to deliver multiple vaccines in a single dose via a nanoparticle carrier system. Early pilot programs indicate improved coverage (34–42%) and enhanced immune durability, while experts stress the importance of long-term monitoring and regulatory coordination. <a href="/news11.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>ALERT: The “Nucleus” Algorithm and the Silent Threat to Digital Resilience</b><br>
The poorly understood Nucleus Algorithm has prompted concern among cyber-risk analysts due to potential supply-chain propagation behaviors reminiscent of the SolarWinds compromise. Limited public documentation and fragmented analysis amplify uncertainty around its systemic risk profile. <a href="/news2.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>CRITICAL THREAT: Android’s IMKO Protocol and Covert Persistence Risks</b><br>
Emerging research suggests that Android’s In-Memory Kernel Obfuscation (IMKO) protocol—intended as a security hardening measure—may introduce complex persistence risks under highly sophisticated exploit conditions. Public analysis remains scarce, leaving significant gaps in understanding potential large-scale impact. <a href="/news3.html">[Click here for more details]</a>

<b>GRAVE WARNING: Kinetic Debris Telemetry Falsification and Orbital Risk</b><br>
Concerns surrounding kinetic debris telemetry falsification highlight how tracking inaccuracies in low-Earth orbit could undermine collision-avoidance systems. Fragmented reporting and limited transparency complicate risk assessment amid rising orbital congestion. <a href="/news4.html">[Click here for more details]</a>
