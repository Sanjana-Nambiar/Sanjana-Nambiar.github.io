## AI Security and Privacy Researcher 

I am **Sanjana Vijayakumar Nambiar**, an aspiring **AI Security and Privacy Researcher** and senior **Computer Science student** at **New York University Abu Dhabi**. My research focuses on safeguarding **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from adversarial vulnerabilities and advancing privacy-preserving AI systems. My academic and professional journey reflects a commitment to addressing critical challenges at the intersection of **AI, cybersecurity, and IoT**.

Currently, I am a **Research Assistant** in the **Data Intelligence and Computation in Engineering (DICE) Lab** at **NYU Tandon**, under the guidance of Prof. Chinmay Hegde. My work involves developing defense mechanisms against **jailbreak attacks** on LLMs and analyzing injection vulnerabilities such as **reference stuffing** to enhance AI alignment metrics like **helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness**.

In parallel, my capstone research in the **Cyber Security and Privacy (CSP) Lab** at NYU Abu Dhabi benchmarks the effectiveness of jailbreak prompts, categorizing attack vectors based on model access levels and proposing robust countermeasures.
