I’m **Sanjana Nambiar**, a Computer Science graduate from NYU Abu Dhabi with minors in Applied Mathematics and Engineering. My interests lie in **AI/ML security**, **privacy in AI systems**, **AI alignment**, and **optimization** techniques for building robust and ethical models. I’m also passionate about **product development** and **AI workflow optimization**, with hands‑on experience bridging research and real‑world impact.

In June 2025, I presented my bachelor thesis at the Security in Machine Learning and its Applications (SiMLA 2025), co‑located with ACNS 2025 in Munich. You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YXF5duFIcuPsV7E2arLNwX-EGhgvRXhgTqOktDS_XZE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [paper](https://sanjana-nambiar.github.io/files/SiMLA-2-main.pdf) *(to appear in Springer LNCS post‑proceedings).*
