Iâ€™m a senior at New York University Abu Dhabi, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Interactive Media. My academic and professional journey spans AI security, data analytics, and product development, with a strong focus on advancing secure and privacy-preserving AI systems

## Professional & Industrial Interests
I am passionate about **product development and data analytics**, leveraging my technical expertise to build innovative, scalable, and data-driven solutions. My experience spans software engineering, AI-driven analytics, and IoT applications, where I develop intelligent systems that solve real-world challenges.

## Research Interests
My research interest focuses on safeguarding **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from adversarial vulnerabilities and advancing privacy-preserving AI systems. My academic and professional journey reflects a commitment to addressing critical challenges at the intersection of **AI, cybersecurity, and IoT**.

Currently, I am a **Research Assistant** in the **Data Intelligence and Computation in Engineering (DICE) Lab** at **NYU Tandon**, under the guidance of Prof. Chinmay Hegde. My work involves developing defense mechanisms against **jailbreak attacks** on LLMs and analyzing injection vulnerabilities such as **reference stuffing** to enhance AI alignment metrics like **helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness**.

In parallel, my capstone research in the **Cyber Security and Privacy (CSP) Lab** at NYU Abu Dhabi benchmarks the effectiveness of jailbreak prompts, categorizing attack vectors based on model access levels and proposing robust countermeasures.

### Key Focus

- **LLM Security and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities**  
  Enhancing robustness of AI systems against adversarial attacks and malicious exploitation.
  
- **Privacy and Ethical AI**  
  Designing privacy-preserving frameworks and aligning AI technologies with ethical standards.

- **IoT and Environmental Monitoring**  
  Building scalable, real-time systems for environmental research using advanced IoT solutions.

- **Cybersecurity in AI Systems**  
  Investigating vulnerabilities in neural networks and proposing defense strategies for secure machine learning.
