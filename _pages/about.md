I‚Äôm Sanjana Nambiar a Computer Science graduate from NYU Abu Dhabi with minors in Applied Mathematics and Engineering.

My interests lie in AI/ML security, privacy in AI systems, AI alignment, and optimization techniques for building robust and ethical models. I‚Äôm also passionate about product development and AI workflow optimization, with hands-on experience bridging research and real-world impact.

I‚Äôve taken advanced courses in deep learning, big data, and security, including:
- Deep Learning and LLM-based Generative AI Systems (NYU Courant, Grad Level)
- Processing Big Data for Analytics Applications (NYU Courant)
- Computer Security and Cryptography (NYU Courant)
- Applied Machine Learning (NYU Abu Dhabi)
- Introduction to Machine Learning (NYU Tandon)

In June 2025, I presented my bachelor thesis at the Security in Machine Learning and its Applications (SiMLA 2025), co-located with ACNS 2025 in Munich. You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YXF5duFIcuPsV7E2arLNwX-EGhgvRXhgTqOktDS_XZE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [paper](https://sanjana-nambiar.github.io/files/SiMLA-2-main.pdf) [The paper will appear in the ACNS 2025 post-proceedings (Springer LNCS)]
